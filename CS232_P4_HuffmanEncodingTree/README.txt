For: B.J. Streller's CS232 Advanced Data Structures at ECC
This Project: is an example of Huffman Encoding Trees. This is a command line
	driven program which reads an input text file and generates an encode table.
	You can then Save the encode table to file, encode the message and save that to
	a separate file.  You can then load the coded message and the encode table to
	decode into plain text.  The assignment did not require spaces to be encoded.
